# DNY - Dynamic Domain Name for You

DNY is a cutting-edge tool that dynamically manages DNS resolution to provide seamless, automated access to websites blocked due to DNS restrictions. The tool identifies DNS-related blocks, dynamically switches to an alternative DNS provider, and ensures an ethical browsing experience by analyzing site content. It operates transparently, requiring zero technical expertise from users.

## Overview

### Problem

Access to specific websites is often restricted due to:
	•	Government censorship.
